Not justice.\nJust cash.\n\nAnd this is not a ‘one-off incident.’\nThis is the system we are told to trust.\nThis is the reality we are forced to live in.\n\nHere’s the obvious question:\n\nIf money can erase crimes like gangrape…\nWhat is the value of a woman’s dignity in this country?\nJust ₹2 lakh?\n\nWe demand women to ‘speak up.’\nWe blame them for ‘not reporting.’\nBut who will they report to…\nWhen the protectors have become the predators of justice?\n\nCorruption is not just about money.\nIt is about lives destroyed in silence.\nIt is about criminals walking free with a smile.\nIt is about victims reliving their trauma every single day.\n\nIndia doesn’t need new slogans.\nIndia doesn’t need new committees.\nIndia needs accountability.\nIndia needs a system where rich criminals don’t get VIP justice…\n\nand poor victims don’t get endless pain.\n\nIf you are reading this, please remember: Sometimes the monster isn’t hiding in the dark.

  "text": "‘Gen Z doesn’t want to struggle.’\nNo - Gen Z refuses to be exploited.\n\nSaw a post where someone complained that a Gen Z employee demanded extra pay for extra hours… and walked out when he didn’t get it.\n\nAnd somehow that became a problem?\n\nLet’s get this straight:\n\nBoomers: ‘Work 14 hours. Don’t complain. Be grateful.’\nMillennials: ‘At least we’ll get promoted in 5 years.’\nGen Z: ‘Pay me for my time. Respect my boundaries. And don’t treat burnout like a badge of honor.’\n\nAnd suddenly, we’re ‘entitled.’\n\nWhy is asking for:\n• Fair pay → entitlement?\n• Work-life balance → lack of commitment?\n• Mental health → weakness?\n• Basic respect → no ‘work ethic’?\n\nMaybe the mindset has changed because the world has changed.\nBecause loyalty doesn’t pay rent anymore.\nBecause ‘struggle’ isn’t a personality trait.\nBecause we saw our parents sacrifice health, happiness & family for companies that replaced them in 2 weeks.\n\nGen Z isn’t running away from hard work.\nThey’re running away from toxic work.\n\nIf valuing boundaries = irresponsible…\nIf refusing free labour = laziness…\nIf knowing your worth = attitude…\n\nThen yes, Gen Z is proudly guilty.\n\nThe generational gap isn’t about work ethic.\nIt’s about self-respect.",
